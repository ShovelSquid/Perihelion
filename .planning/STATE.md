# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-14)

**Core value:** A single coherent simulation loop, map to hangar to shuttle to mission to consequences, that runs in real time whether or not the player is looking, and hands a mech, pilot and loadout to the shooter layer at the right place and time.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation and Paper Skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation and Paper Skeleton)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and ROADMAP.md Standing Decisions.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap D1]: Revive `Fixed`, `DetRandom`, `Command`, `World.Step`, `StateHash`, `SimRunner` from `main:Assets/Sim/` into a new namespaced core at Phase 4; drop `Squad`/`Unit` pooling; park `Opinion.cs`. Fixed-point vs pure integers settled in Phase 1 once the map model exists.
- [Roadmap D2]: Class basis is argued in Phase 1, not assumed. Research proposes `Def`, `Entity`, `Activity`, `Event`, `World` over the vault's seven primaries and Helios's node-only ontology.
- [Roadmap D3]: No runnable strategy-layer code before the worked loop (Phase 3) reads clean.
- [PROJECT.md]: Real time with shuttle travel as the pacing unit, no turns; unpiloted missions resolve over real duration; shooter entered via a handoff contract; social and faction depth deferred.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1, resolved at planning per D-14]: `Design/` is tracked in git (35 files, commit `f216a38`); vault drift is visible through `git status`. The earlier "untracked" concern was stale.
- [Phase 1]: Concepts with no vault note (Shuttle, Mission, Pilot, Worker, Hangar, Launch Site, Base, Alert) need `Overview/ProposedForDesign.md`; the user folds them into the vault on their side.
- [Phase 3]: Mid-mission take-over state transfer and resolver shape are flagged for a spike before `60-Handoff.md` is written.
- [Phase 4]: No .NET SDK installed on the dev machine (runtimes only); needed before the port.
- [v2]: `Assets/Management/` duplicate `Building` compile break must clear before any Unity view or shooter adapter lands; not a v1 concern.
